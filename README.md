## Tracking Honey Bee Colony Loss in the US

## Overview

### Question: Why Should We Care About Honey Bees? No Honey Bees = No Food

- The United States Department of Agriculture estimates that pollinators such as bees and butterflies help pollinate approximately 75 percent of the world's flowering plants and      pollinate roughly 35 percent of the world's food cropsâ€”including fruits and vegetables.

- Commercial production of many high-value and specialty crops like almonds and other tree nuts, berries, fruits and vegetables depend on pollination by honey bees.  Almonds, for example, are almost completely dependent on honey bees for pollination. In California, the almond industry makes use of almost three-quarter of all managed honey bee colonies in the United States, brought from all over the country during one short window of time in January and February each year.

- It is estmated that one mouthful in three in our diet directly or indirectly benefits from honey bee pollination.
