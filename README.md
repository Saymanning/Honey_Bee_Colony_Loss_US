## Tracking Honey Bee Colony Loss in the US

## Overview

### Why Should We Care About Honey Bees? No Honey Bees = No Food

- Agricultural productivity in the US is highly dependent on the European honey bee (Apis mellifera)

- The United States Department of Agriculture estimates that pollinators such as bees and butterflies help pollinate approximately 75 percent of the world's flowering plants and      pollinate roughly 35 percent of the world's food cropsâ€”including fruits and vegetables.

- Commercial production of many high-value and specialty crops like almonds and other tree nuts, berries, fruits and vegetables depend on pollination by honey bees.  Almonds, for example, are almost completely dependent on honey bees for pollination. In California, the almond industry makes use of almost three-quarter of all managed honey bee colonies in the United States, brought from all over the country during one short window of time in January and February each year.

- It is estmated that one mouthful in three in our diet directly or indirectly benefits from honey bee pollination.

### Threats to Honey Bee Population in the US:

- Colony Collaspe Disorder (CCD)
- Parasite - Varroa mites
- Pathogens
- Poor Nutrition
- Pesticides
- Improper Management of Bee Colonies - Queen Quality

Data Sources:
- USDA National Agriculture Statistics Service: https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/

### Purpose of this analysis:

  The purpose of this analysis is to analyze the data on Honey Bee Colony Loss over the past decade to determine if the measures implemented by the USDA and other organizations to improve general Honey Bee health and habitate have been and are effective.
  
 **Other questions we hope to answer:**
  - Are there specific measures that are more effecrive than others?
  - What else can be done to help improve the health and habitate of Honey Bees in the US?
  - What can the general public do to help?
